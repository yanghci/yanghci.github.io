I spent a productive and meaningful week in the beautiful historical town Lancaster during January 12--16.

Six people of the Aarhus team flew to Lancaster on Monday. On Tuesday, we visited Lancaster University along with our sister lab -- <a href="https://www.gemini-erc.org/">GEMINI</a>. On Wednesday and Thursday, the workshop continued at the Lancaster Castle and Storey. Within the three-day workshop, we listened to and presented talks about everyone's research.
